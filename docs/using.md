# Using
To use Macinstyle, you need to have access to the CSS and JS files. Their are a couple ways to get these.

## CDN (Coming soon)
You can use a CDN to get the CSS and JS files.

All you have to do is include these to elements in your code:<br>
```<link rel='stylesheet' href='Coming Soon'>```<br>
and:<br>
```<script src='Coming soon'></script>```

## Source
Another way is to download the source files. You can get these [here](https://github.com/mr-winson/macinstyle/build) (repository) or [here](https://github.com/mr-winson/macinstyle/releases) (releases).
